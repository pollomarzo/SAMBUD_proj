# Systems and Methods for Big and Unstructured Data project

SAMFBAUD for some, SAMBUD to most, MAMOUD to friends, this is where we'll host our code, reports and diagrams for all phases of the project

## Phase 1: Neo4j

Everything you could ever need or want is in the `01` folder. For this one, we made a simple DB explorer webapp. It even has a cute little graph... Have fun!

## Phase 2: MongoDB

This time, we focused on making something useful: in our `02` folder you'll find all your boring documents and a simple app (with a complicated background) together with an nodeJS+Express middleware to avoid the messy messy Android MongoDB driver.
